        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>15 minutes</p>

        <h2>Lab Goals</h2>

        <p>
            The primary goal of this exercise is to demonstrate the use of NUnit with Visual Studio. This is a <em>demonstration</em> done by the instructor, but the exercise instructions are listed here in order to perform the tests on your own.

                This will go through the process of creating a unit test and run the unit test locally to give you a taste of how unit tests are created and executed. To create unit tests in Visual Studio, we begin by creating a NUnit Library Project. While we often create new solutions for projects, a better idea would be to add a new Test project to an existing solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                As mentioned in the lecture, there are a few different ways to create unit test projects. Visual Studio has several built-in project templates you can use. Since we are going to be testing business logic in this example, we will use the full NUnit project type.

Visual Studio has several built-in project templates for other testing frameworks you can use. Since we are going to be testing business logic with NUnit in this example, we will set up a new class library to use the NUnit framework.

        <h2>Required Assets</h2>
        <p>
            There is a completed version of the solution in the <b>Exercise 1</b> folder if you'd like to compare your results, or just run the test.
        </p>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <p>
            Lets start by creating the logic for our application by creating a new solution with a single class library in the solution. In this solution we will create a single class library that contains a class that calculates a <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/management_concepts/pert_estimation_technique.htm">PERT estimate</a> based on the best case, worst case and expected case of a project task.

            <li>
                Rename the single C# source file to <b>PertEstimate.cs</b>. You can do this by right-clicking on the class <ide name="vs">file in the Solution Explorer and selecting <b>Rename</b></ide><ide name="xs">name and selecting <b>Refactor > Rename</b></ide>. This will also allow you to rename the source file at the same time, which is convenient.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the following static method to the file. This is what we will be testing.
<pre class="prettyprint codeblock">

                Lets create our first unit test to test our <code>Estimate</code> functions results. Replace the existing class file's code with this code:
<pre class="prettyprint codeblock">
using Calculations;
using NUnit.Framework;

namespace PertTests
{
    [TestFixture]
    public class TestPertEstimates
    {
        [Test]
        public void PertEstimate_CalculationWithPositiveValues_CheckAccuracyIsSuccess ()
        {
            // Arrange
            double likelyAmount = 20;
            double bestCaseAmount = 12;
            double worstCaseAmount = 40;
            double estimatedResult = 22;

            // Act
            double actualAmount = PertEstimate.Estimate (likelyAmount,
                                            bestCaseAmount, worstCaseAmount);

            // Assert
            Assert.AreEqual (estimatedResult, actualAmount);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                This is a <code>TestFixture</code> named <b>TestPertEstimates</b> to indicate the system under test, which this class is intended to test. It has a method with the <code>[Test]</code> attribute. These attributes tell NUnit (and the Visual Studio Test Explorer) which methods to run as tests. Each method that you add with the <code>[Test]</code> attribute will automatically become an additional test in your unit test project.
                <p>You can see that we are following the same model of Arrange > Act > Assert to test that our class follows the core functionality that we need. All your tests should follow this pattern and you should make sure to name your tests appropriately with long, descriptive names so you can tell at a glance what is being tested and what the result should be.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Since our test calls the PERT logic in our class library, add a project reference for the test project to use the <b>Calculations</b> project. This will allow us to call the <code>PertEstimate.Estimate</code> method.
